        Franz Schubert, (born Jan. 31, 1797, Himmelpfortgrund, near Vienna—died Nov. 19, 1828, Vienna), 
        Austrian composer. He learned violin from his schoolteacher father and piano from his brother. 
        He joined the precursor of the Vienna Boys Choir (1808), making such quick progress that 
        Antonio Salieri undertook to guide his training (1810–16). At his family’s insistence, 
        he was trained as a schoolteacher. In 1815 he wrote 2 symphonies, more than 100 songs, and 4 stage works. 
        In 1818, seeking independence, he quit teaching at his father’s school to tutor Johann Esterházy’s daughters. 
        In 1819–20 he wrote the celebrated Trout Quintet and a mass. In 1821, 20 of his most popular songs were 
        published with great success, and he wrote the three-act opera Alfonso und Estrella. Despite his first 
        awareness of the disease (possibly syphilis) that would kill him, his amazing production continued in 
        1822, with the Unfinished Symphony and the Wanderer Fantasy. He was often ill during his last five 
        years but continued his production of music, including the song cycles The Miller’s Beautiful Daughter and 
        Winter Journey, the last three piano sonatas, and the Great Symphony. His last years were made miserable by 
        illness, not poverty; in fact, his greatness was widely recognized. He died at 31, having produced more 
        masterpieces by that age than almost any other composer in history. His 600 songs made the lied a serious 
        genre and sparked its great development in subsequent decades.
